###  I was graduated, please other authors 

&nbsp;&nbsp;  I don not want to answer your question about FlowScope, please contact other authors for details, and the source code of FlowScope is migrated into spartan2 (<https://github.com/BGT-M/spartan2-tutorials/blob/master/FlowScope.ipynb>)(I hope you never open this link, and keep away from the fucking anti-money laundering).  


&nbsp;&nbsp;  Before you proceed to do anti-money laundering, I strongly suggest you read the following passage: https://github.com/aplaceof/FlowScope/blob/main/voice.md, and decide to go on or not, I hope you get a better feature and keep away from the fucking anti-money laundering. Anti-money laundering is not a good  choice, the man who fucking says anti-money laundering is good and wants or force you  do it will never care about your feature, be careful,  never trust them, otherwise  you will get nothing when you want to find a job when you about graduate, but only suffers, especilly you are poor. 

About all of the thing I have  experieced, I only want to say fuck, fuck, fuck.

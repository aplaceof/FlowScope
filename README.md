###  I was graduated, please other authors 

&nbsp;&nbsp;  I don not want to answer your question about FlowScope, please contact other authors for details, and the source code of FlowScope is migrated into spartan2 (<https://github.com/BGT-M/spartan2-tutorials/blob/master/FlowScope.ipynb>)(I hope you never open this link).  


&nbsp;&nbsp;  Before you proceed to do anti-money laundering, I strongly suggest you investigate the commercial situation of anti-money laundering(you can read this paragraph https://github.com/aplaceof/FlowScope/blob/main/analyis.md ), and decide to go on or not, I hope you get a better feature and keep away from the fucking anti-money laundering. Anti-money laundering is not a good  choice,  do not  do it, otherwise  you will get nothing when you want to find a job when you about graduate, but only suffers, especilly you are poor.

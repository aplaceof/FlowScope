&nbsp;&nbsp;  I don not want to answer your question about FlowScope, please contact other authors for details, and the source code of FlowScope is migrated into spartan2 (<https://github.com/BGT-M/spartan2-tutorials/blob/master/FlowScope.ipynb>)(I hope you never open this link, stop doing anti-money laundering).  


&nbsp;&nbsp;  Before you proceed to do anti-money laundering, I strongly suggest you investigate the commercial situation of anti-money laundering(you could read this paragraph https://github.com/aplaceof/FlowScope/blob/main/analyis.md ), and decide to go on or not, I hope you get a better feature and keep away from the fucking  anti-money laundering. Anti-money laundering is not a good  choice,  do not do it, otherwise  you will get nothing when you want to find a job when you about graduate, but only suffers, especilly you are poor. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anti-money laundering does not create and profit or value directly, and money laundering is not harmful directly, the things get realy harmed is the activity that produce the dirty money, this is the origin of crime.   Have you ever thought about it, money laundering is the last step of illicit property activity, legalizing illegal funds. Why there is no one care about it while these illicit activity is going on and making dirty money? Don’t tell me, it’s because no one is aware of that. The scale of money laundering is usually hundreds of millions，and there is no one aware of such a large economic activity, are you kidding me? But why these people, include the goverment, don’t care about these  illicit activity (not ignore totally, some illicit activities, such as national security, are under strict supervising, the key is that they do not value anti-money laundering )? They ignore all these things, just wait for the last stage when the criminals doing money laundering, and let you find all these criminals and save the world?

&nbsp;&nbsp;   The most import for a person is not how hard he work, but what he choose and is doing now. I you think this article some how make sense, please give me a star. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;   To all of the things I've experienced, I only want to say fuck.

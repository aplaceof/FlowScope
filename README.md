###  I was graduated, please other authors 

&nbsp;&nbsp;  I was graduated, please contact other authors for details, and the source code of FlowScope is migrated into spartan2 (<https://github.com/BGT-M/spartan2-tutorials/blob/master/FlowScope.ipynb>).  Before you proceed to do anti-money laundering, I strongly suggest you read the following passage: https://github.com/aplaceof/FlowScope/blob/main/voice.md, and decide to go on or not, I hope you get a better feature.

## attention please:

I am the first author of this paper, my email is *aplaceof at bupt.edu.cn*. 
### first: do not send me any email 
do not send any email to me asking for the code or dataset, I delete all of the code and dataset completely from my computer,  because I can not find any good job with this paper.

If you are really interested, you could rewrite the code on your own or ask other author for help. 
### second： anti-money laundering is not a good choice 

Anti-money laundering is not fundmental, or prerequisite to any other business. What all company want is money, is porfit, but anti-money laundering does not create any value directly. 

If you can build a car, why choose to repair a car? Your repairment can get paied just because the car is valuable, who want to repair a car valued at 10,000, but spend 11,000? Yes, I am say about doing something that create value directly compared with the other supporting conditions. You might argue there are many job about security(supporting conditions)，and get high pay. But you need to distinguish them carefully, the basic security, such as personal safety, cyber security, is the prerequisites to all  other things, and the people protect such security always get high pay, or have great power. The army and police protect national security and personal safety enjoys great power, and the soft engineers who ensure cyber security protecting  server from attacking, customer information from leakage or financial system from being alerted get their high pay. But abnormal detection or anti-money laundering is not that case,  the purpose for doing these things is limiting them in a reasonable range, not eradicates them completely, which is totally different from security. 

Anti-money laundering is an useless and worthless thing for a person who want to find a good job, and it is also worthless for a company.  If you are doing this now, I suggest you stop, and maybe you could choose software development as your career. 

If you don't trust me, search the annual report of the company of  LexisNexis or RELX, one of the biggest company that have anti-money laundering business, and  their mainly business operators in Europe and North America, where the financial system is quite mature, and the governments pay more attentions to the anti-money laundering problem.  you can know how much you can earn when you doing anti-money laundering. 

### third:  believe yourself 
Don't trust anyone who says anti-money laundering is a good choice, at least in China.   They stressed repeatedly  to instill in you  that  how brighter your feature is if you choose anit-money laundering,  which has never been supported by data, believing in the real data you have seen on your own eyes. 

see this introduction  of RELX: at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELX .
see this annual report of RELX at:
https://www.relx.com/~/media/Files/R/RELX-Group/documents/reports/annual-reports/2019-annual-report.pdf 
page 137,  the section of "ANALYSIS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT", and anti-money laundering only a part of revenue in "Risk & Business Analytics" segment.  
Surely, you can also search these information on your own.

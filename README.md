  I don not want to answer your questions about FlowScope, please contact other authors for details. 

### why you should stop

  Before you proceed to do anti-money laundering, I strongly suggest you investigate the commercial situation of anti-money laundering(you could read this paragraph below), and decide to go on or not, I hope you get a better feature and keep away from the fucking anti-money laundering. Anti-money laundering is not a good choice, do not do it, otherwise you will get nothing when you want to find a job when you about graduate, but only suffers, especially you are poor. I don not want you follow my step and see the suffers I've experienced happened on you and get desperate when you can not find any good job. **In China, the purpose of anti-money laundering cooperation between banks and other companies or schools is not really to do well in anti-money laundering, but the leaders of the banks need political achievements. If you do not understand what I am saying, you do not understand the current status of anti-money laundering in China.**

**Never trust the man who says anti-money laundering is good, never，they will never care about your feature, they just care about themselves and may cheat on you that what they are doing now is good for you with their heart and soul, it was so shameless. If you think this article some how make sense, please give a star.** Anti-money laundering does not create and profit or value directly, and money laundering is not harmful directly, the things get really harmed is the activity that produce the dirty money, this is the origin of crime.

  Anti-money laundering does not create and profit or value directly, and money laundering is not harmful directly, the things get really harmed is the activity that produce the dirty money, this is the origin of crime. Also anti-money laundering do not create any value directly, the importance of the man who doing anti-money laundering will never exceeds a good sale man to the company. 

​    Have you ever thought about it, money laundering is the last step of illicit property activity, legalizing illegal funds. Why there is no one care about it while these illicit activity is going on and making dirty money? Don’t tell me,           it’s because no one is aware of that. The scale of money laundering is usually hundreds of millions，and there is no one aware of such a large economic activity, are you kidding me? But why these people, include the government, don’t care about these illicit activity (not ignore totally, some illicit activities, such as something about the national security, are under strict supervising, the key is that they do not value anti-money laundering )? They ignore all these things, just wait for the last stage when the criminals doing money laundering, and let you find all these criminals and save the world?

### business analysis of the fucking anti-money laundering

  Anti-money laundering is a not good choice, at least in China, see the analysis of anti-money laundering below.

#### business analysis of anti-money laundering in Europe and North America

  you can search the annual report of RELX, one of the biggest company that have anti-money laundering business, and their mainly business operators in Europe and North America, where the financial system is quite mature, and the governments pay more attentions to the anti-money laundering problem. In other words, RELX earns the most of profit and represents the ceiling that one anti-money laundering company can reach.

  see this introduction of RELX: at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELX .

  see this annual report of RELX at: https://www.relx.com/~/media/Files/R/RELX-Group/documents/reports/annual-reports/2019-annual-report.pdf. On page 137, the section of "ANALYSIS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT", you can see that the revenue of "Risk & Business Analytics" segment is only 2,316 £m in 2019, and anti-money laundering only a part of it. See the detail at: https://www.relx.com/our-business/market-segments/risk-and-business-analytics. the market of the fucking anti-money laundering is so small that most of company with not pay it, I never heard any large company will take the fucking anti-money laundering as its main business and they never will. I have never heard about RELX before, I know about the company of RELX because I spent many time searching on google to survey just for telling you that the status of the fucking many laundering in Europe and North America, where the financial system is quite mature, and the governments pay more attentions, but the profit is also extremely low.

#### business analysis of anti-money laundering in China

  If you are a Chinese people, you could browse the flowing websites, which are more relevant. If you are not familiar with Chinese, then I will tell you the relevant statistics directly. The total amount of fines for anti-money laundering received by thousands of banks and financial institutions in China is : 2017, less than 1 hundred million ¥； 2019， 1.7 hundred million ¥ ； 2020， 6.28 hundred million ¥. Although the fine grows rapidly, but it still means nothing to thousands of banks and financial institutions in China on average. If you you do not trust me, you can use google translate to browse this information on your own.

  \4. money laundering about two of Chinese biggest bank Hong Kong(Asia) department with its executives involved, if you are interested, search on yourself. I can not say too much here.

​     According to the information in the website above, the fine of anti-money laundering in a whole year for all of banks in China may even not exceed the turnover of Apple, MicroSoft in a single day, do you believe that, all of banks, a whole year. There are thousands of financial company in china, which means the average fine of anti-money laundering for each financial company is incredible low, even not enough to hire people to do that.

​    If you are a student in China, I strongly suggest you stop doing anti-money laundering, you will know how hard it would be to find a job when you are about graduate from school, but it was too late. And it will be similar, both the fine of anti-money laundering and the difficulty for you to find a job in many other countries. In Europe and North America, the situation may be better， because the financial system is quite mature there, and the governments pay more attentions to the anti-money laundering problem. In China, I have never heard of any listed company whose primary business is anti-money laundering, and I have never heard bankruptcy because of anti-money laundering problem around the world.

### read the paragraph below, Stop doing the fucking anti-money laundering

  Anti-money laundering is useless in most of countries, where you can not find any good job，but only get suffers during job interview. And, normally, add some rule in the bank system is good enough to do anti-money laundering, there is seldom need for artificial intelligence and algorithm to do it. If you do not know what to do, software development is a good choice, if you really do not know what to do, sleeping in bed is a much better choice, at least you do nothing and get nothing. Anti-money laundering is a big trap. I spent many times, many effort to do this kind of fucking work,  but I got  nothing in return.

  Doing anti-money laundering can not bring you nothing, but only suffers when you want to find a job ,it was real time costing, no enough time to do any other thing, useless to find a good job and mire you into the poverty, if you are forced to do this, there will no happiness during your school life. The average fine of anti-money laundering per financial company in China per year will not exceed the profit of a house loan in the big cities, think about it. The government and banks will never pay attention to anti-money laundering problem, they just act as if they value it, but it is just an illusion. 

​     I really do not understand why some people choose this direction, useless for society, useless for themselves, and useless for students. If you put the same effort on neural networks, the pay back will be several times higher, both for you and your advisor. The paper included too much theories is very hard for other people to understand, include the paper interviewer, there are very few people could understand what I am doing, that means you can not get any appreciation during your job interview. You are not writing about some thing important, which can promote the development of society and science , why other people should spend their time listening.   Suppose you are the expert in anti-money laundering , though you do the best in the world,  you can never create any direct value for the company, your importance will never exceeds a good salesman in the company, you work harder, you are more devoted, you are ambitious, what does it means?  The company never needs such hard work in the anti-money laundering area , they needs sales volume, needs profit, but never anti-money laundering.

  I delete all of the code and dataset because I can not find any good job with this fucking paper, I do not want to see it any more. The paper is really time consuming because of the rarity of dataset and the difficulty of theory derivation, very hard to derive some theoretical boundary, but what I got was extremely low. When I was about graduate, I can not find any good job, My classmates who research neural networks or do software development find the job with salary even 2、3 times than me, even they play more games,  even they work several hours less than me every day, even I know more about computer system relatively. I spent 1.5 year on this time consuming work, too much time, no other time to learn other things. So before you proceed doing anti-money laundering, I strongly suggest you think about it.  I do not want see you follow my step, and get desperate when you can not find any job. Direction is more important than hard work. If you have similar experience, please give me a star, let other people know that I am telling the truth.

  I hate it, not only because it is too difficult and very time-consuming, but also because it is useless and there are few needs about it in the society, and I could predict that in the foreseeable future, no one will pay attention to anti-money laundering, at least in China. Unlike the research brain-computer interface, though it is very difficult, the research process is full of ups and downs， it can significantly improve work efficiency and has broad application prospects. It is still worthwhile to do that, and the company of country are more willing to invest such research. Just search on the google scholar and see the number of cite, you will see the gap between them, not to mention neural network.

  The country would rather spend billions or tens of billions of dollars to fight wars than to spend a penny on anti-money laundering. War, money laundering, and illegal property are all of the dark side of mankind. I think you should know what I am meaning, if you do not know what I am saying , think about **bit corn**, why such a corn **values so much**.  If I invade a country and plunder tens of billions of dollars, this kind of behavior is very common in the history, and it often accompanies this massacre. How to define this kind of behavior? money laundering? murder? This behavior comes from the highest level of government, who will supervise this and gives punishment ? You spend the best age of your life doing this kind of fucking work, but when you want to find a job, there is no need for such fucking work, take care. Never believe any promises and bright feature about doing anti-money laundering, these promises will never  be fulfilled.

### feasibility and necessity of anti-money laundering, stop doing this

 Anti-money laundering is not fundamental, or prerequisite to any other business. What all company want is money, is profit, but anti-money laundering does not create any value directly.

  If you can build a car, why choose to repair a car? Your repairment can get payed just because the car is valuable, who want to repair a car valued at 10,000, but spend 11,000? Yes, I am say about doing something that create value directly compared with the other supporting conditions. You might argue there are many job about security(supporting conditions)，and get high pay. But you need to distinguish them carefully, the basic security, such as personal safety, cyber security, is the prerequisites to all other things, and the people protect such security always get high pay, or have great power. The army and police protect national security and personal safety enjoys great power, and the soft engineers who ensure cyber security protecting server from attacking, customer information from leakage or financial system from being alerted get their high pay. But abnormal detection or anti-money laundering is not that case, the purpose for doing these things is limiting them in a reasonable range, not eradicates them completely, which is totally different from security. Not mention that some company create some abnormal manually just for earn money， and how do you think about it? use your technology to prevent it and you boss will be very happy ?

  Anti-money laundering is an useless and worthless thing for a person who want to find a good job, and it is also worthless for a company. Personally, I think that software development is a better choice. If you don't trust me, see the business analysis of anti-money laundering on the top.

  In many cases, anti-money laundering is not a technical issue. Suppose I am omniscient and omnipotent, knowing of all people that involved in money laundering, and I submit the list of these people to you, do you dare to arrest these people? Many people who are capable of doing money laundering are high-ranking officials, wealthy people, terrorists, underworld, and drug dealers, they all have the ability to kill you. Who wants to reject the chance to earn money, especially the financial sector. If you are interested, you can learn what can a financial get during money laundering process.

  Have you ever thought about it, money laundering is the last step of illicit property activity, legalizing illegal funds. Why there is no one in care about it while these illicit property is going on and making dirty money? Don’t tell me, it’s because no one is aware of that. The scale of money laundering is usually hundreds of millions，and there is no one aware of such a large economic activity, are you kidding me? But why these people don’t care about it ? They ignore the illicit activity, just wait for the last stage when the criminals doing money laundering, and let you find all these criminals and save the world? Why don't you report and complaint the corrupt officials around you? They are more harmful.

  Do you think anti-money is mainly a technology problem issue ? See this page, https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-04/commonwealth-bank-pay-$700-million-fine-money-laundering-breach/9831064. Commonwealth Bank got the fine because it failed to report the 53,506 transactions， 53,506 transactions you know? Think about that there are many countries and regions which are performs as the haven for money laundering, tax avoidance, gambling, and asset transfer directly in the world. Normally, anti-money laundering is rule based, requires little about algorithm, it ask you to learn more about the law, not computer. Though you do the best anti-money laundering in the world, you can still be useless, no company needs such ability and never will.

  I don not want the same situation happed on you, so stop doing it. I do not have the enough ability to solve this problem, so the method is this paper is odd， I can not propose any good idea after so many tries in 1.5 year time, but only such a farfetched algorithm and explanation. If you are doing  anti-money laundering and knowing about the fact of anti-money laundering now , then you should think about your feature **on your own** . I hope you can stop doing anti-money laundering and find a good job, especially you or your family are poor. Anti-money laundering can not bring you anything, except for the suffering when you want to find a job. If you have similar fucking experience, please give me a star, let other people know that I am telling the truth.

Quoting a Chinese poem：

```
                                              满纸荒唐言，一把辛酸泪。 

                                              都云作者痴，谁解其中味。 
```

English version:

```
                                            Pages full of fantastic talk,

                                            Penned with bitter tears;

                                            All men call the author mad,

                                            None his message hears.
```

If you have any questions, you can post your question in the issue section.

Here are some news about money laundering, pay attention to the amount, why the activity of money laundering only when the amount comes so large.

- https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1713377036249435134&wfr=spider&for=pc. This is a Chinese news, the amount of money laundering is 75.6 billion ￥, think about it.

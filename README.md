### second： anti-money laundering is not a good choice 

Anti-money laundering is not fundmental, or prerequisite to any other business. What all company want is money, is porfit, but anti-money laundering does not create any value directly. 

If you can build a car, why choose to repair a car? Your repairment can get paied just because the car is valuable, who want to repair a car valued at 10,000, but spend 11,000? Yes, I am say about doing something that create value directly compared with the other supporting conditions. You might argue there are many job about security(supporting conditions)，and get high pay. But you need to distinguish them carefully, the basic security, such as personal safety, cyber security, is the prerequisites to all  other things, and the people protect such security always get high pay, or have great power. The army and police protect national security and personal safety enjoys great power, and the soft engineers who ensure cyber security protecting  server from attacking, customer information from leakage or financial system from being alerted get their high pay. But abnormal detection or anti-money laundering is not that case,  the purpose for doing these things is limiting them in a reasonable range, not eradicates them completely, which is totally different from security. 

Anti-money laundering is an useless and worthless thing for a person who want to find a good job, and it is also worthless for a company.  If you are doing this now, I suggest you stop, and maybe you could choose software development as your career. 

If you don't trust me, search the annual report of the company of  LexisNexis or RELX, one of the biggest company that have anti-money laundering business, and  their mainly business operators in Europe and North America, where the financial system is quite mature, and the governments pay more attentions to the anti-money laundering problem.  you can know how much you can earn when you doing anti-money laundering. 

### third:  believe the truth   
Don't trust anyone who says anti-money laundering is a good choice, at least in China. They stressed repeatedly to instill in you that how brighter your feature is if you choose anit-money laundering,  which has never been supported by data and never will, believing the real data you have seen on your own eyes. 

see this introduction  of RELX: at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELX .

see this annual report of RELX at: https://www.relx.com/~/media/Files/R/RELX-Group/documents/reports/annual-reports/2019-annual-report.pdf. 
On page 137,  the section of "ANALYSIS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT", you can see that the revenue of  "Risk & Business Analytics" segment is only 2,316 £m in 2019, and anti-money laundering only a part of it. See the detail at: https://www.relx.com/our-business/market-segments/risk-and-business-analytics.


If you are a Chinese, you could browse the flowing websites, which are more relevant:

See the tiny amount of fine, you can know, what does anti-money laundering  mean to a Chinese bank. The fine of anti-money laundering in a whole year for all of banks in China may even not exceed the turnover of Apple, MicroSoft in a single day, do you believe that, all of banks, a whole year.  If you are a student in China,  I strongly suggest you stop doing anti-money laundering,  when you are about graduate from school,  you will how hard it would be for you to find a job. In China, I have never heard of any listed company  whose primary business is anti-money laundering. And it will be the similar, both the fine of anti-money laundering and the difficulty for you to find a job, in many other countries. 

Surely, you can also search these informations on  your own.

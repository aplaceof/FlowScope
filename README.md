&nbsp;&nbsp;  I don not want to answer your question about FlowScope, please contact other authors for details, and the source code of FlowScope is migrated into spartan2 (<https://github.com/BGT-M/spartan2-tutorials/blob/master/FlowScope.ipynb>)(I hope you never open this link, stop doing anti-money laundering).  

###  why you should stop 

&nbsp;&nbsp;  Before you proceed to do anti-money laundering, I strongly suggest you investigate the commercial situation of anti-money laundering(you could read this paragraph https://github.com/aplaceof/FlowScope/blob/main/analyis.md ), and decide to go on or not, I hope you get a better feature and keep away from the fucking  anti-money laundering. Anti-money laundering is not a good  choice,  do not do it, otherwise  you will get nothing when you want to find a job when you about graduate, but only suffers, especilly you are poor.  I don not want you follow my step and see the suffers I've experienced happeded on you  and get desperate when you can not find any good job. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anti-money laundering does not create and profit or value directly, and money laundering is not harmful directly, the things get realy harmed is the activity that produce the dirty money, this is the origin of crime. Also  anti-money laundering do not create any value directly, the importance of the man who doing  anti-money laundering will never exceeds a good sale man to the company.  Have you ever thought about it, money laundering is the last step of illicit property activity, legalizing illegal funds. Why there is no one care about it while these illicit activity is going on and making dirty money? Don’t tell me, it’s because no one is aware of that. The scale of money laundering is usually hundreds of millions，and there is no one aware of such a large economic activity, are you kidding me? But why these people, include the goverment, don’t care about these  illicit activity (not ignore totally, some illicit activities, such as something about  the national security, are under strict supervising, the key is that they do not value anti-money laundering )? They ignore all these things, just wait for the last stage when the criminals doing money laundering, and let you find all these criminals and save the world? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;   The most import for a person is not how hard he work, but what he choose and is doing now. If you think this article some how make sense, please give me a star.  I really do not understand why some people choose this direction, useless for society, useless for themselves, and useless for students, resulting in bad influence both for me and themselves.  If they put the same effort on neural networks or any other things that can  creat value directly or related to the basic security(such as  network security, pay system security, which  is the foundation  for all other business and can never be neglected by a company ), the pay back will be serverl times higher, both for them and their students. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;   Never trust the man who  fucking  says anti-money laundering is good, never, they will never care about your feature, be careful. To all of those things I've experienced, I have nothing to say, but  only fuck. I don not want you follow my step and see the suffers I've experienced happeded on you when you can not find any good job, so stop doing it. If I have been helped warm hearted, I'll never saying a word in the article.

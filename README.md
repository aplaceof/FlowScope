### first: please contact other authors 

&nbsp;&nbsp; The source code of FlowScope is migrated into spartan2 (<https://github.com/BGT-M>) with easy-to-follow tutorials by authors (<https://github.com/BGT-M/spartan2-tutorials/blob/master/FlowScope.ipynb>). 

&nbsp;&nbsp; Please contact other authors for questions. Maybe, you can connect to shenghua liu, the second author of this paper for help, his email is  liushenghua at ict.ac.cn, just replace at with @. But before you connect to other authors, I  strongly suggest you read the following passage, and decide to going on anti-money laundering or not. Anti-money laundering is useless in most of countries, where you can not find any good job，but only get suffers during job interview. If you do not know, software development is a good choice, or you really do not know what to do, sleeping in bed is a much better choice, at least you do nothing and get nothing. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; I delete all of the code and dataset bacause I can not find any good job with this paper, I do not want to it any more. The paper is really time  consuming, very hard to derive some  theoretical boundary, but what I got was extremly low. When I was about graduate, I can not find any good job, My classmates who  research neural networks or do  software development find the job  with salary even 2 times than me, even they play more games, even they work several hours less than me every day, even I know more about computer system relatively. I spent 1.5 year on this time consuming work, too much time, no other time to learn other thinghs. So before you proceed doing anti-money laundeiring, I strongly suggest you read the following passages. I do not want see you follow my step, and get desperate when you can not find any job. Direction is more important than hard work. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate it, not only because it is too difficult and very time-consuming, but also because it is useless and there are few needs about it in the society, and I could predict that  in the foreseeable future, no one will pay attention to anti-money laundering, at least in China. Unlike the research brain-computer interface, though it is very difficult, the research process is full of ups and downs， it can significantly improve work efficiency and has broad application prospects.  It is still worthwhile  to do that, and the company of country are more willing to invest such research. Just search on the google scholar and see the number of cite, you will see the gap between them, not to mention neural network.


&nbsp;&nbsp; The country would rather spend billions or tens of billions of dollars to fight wars than to spend a penny on anti-money laundering. War, money laundering, and illegal property are all of the dark side of mankind. I think you should know what I am meaning. If I invade a country and plunder tens of billions of dollars, this kind of behavior is very common in the history, and it often accompanies this massacre. How to define this kind of behavior? Money laundering? This behavior comes from the highest level of government, who will supervise this and gives punishment ? Those who says that the aim for doing anti-money laundering is to increase the well-being of mankind, why not go to Syria to stop the war.

### second：feasibility and necessity of anti-money laundering

&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-money laundering is not fundmental, or prerequisite to any other business. What all company want is money, is porfit, but anti-money laundering does not create any value directly. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can build a car, why choose to repair a car? Your repairment can get paied just because the car is valuable, who want to repair a car valued at 10,000, but spend 11,000? Yes, I am say about doing something that create value directly compared with the other supporting conditions. You might argue there are many job about security(supporting conditions)，and get high pay. But you need to distinguish them carefully, the basic security, such as personal safety, cyber security, is the prerequisites to all  other things, and the people protect such security always get high pay, or have great power. The army and police protect national security and personal safety enjoys great power, and the soft engineers who ensure cyber security protecting  server from attacking, customer information from leakage or financial system from being alerted get their high pay. But abnormal detection or anti-money laundering is not that case,  the purpose for doing these things is limiting them in a reasonable range, not eradicates them completely, which is totally different from security. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; Anti-money laundering is an useless and worthless thing for a person who want to find a good job, and it is also worthless for a company.  Personly, I think that software development is a better choice. If you don't trust me,  see the business analysis of anti-money laundering below.

&nbsp;&nbsp; In many cases, anti-money laundering is not a technical issue. Suppose I am omniscient and omnipotent, knowing of all people that involved in money laundering,  and I submit the list of these people to  you, do you dare to arrest these people? Many people who are capable of doing  money  laundering are high-ranking officials, wealthy people, terrorists, underworld, and drug dealers. Catching them does making any profit for you, or any direct profit for a  bank. Who wants to  get into  trouble with money, especially the financial  the financial sector. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever thought about it, money laundering is the last step of  illicit property  activity, legalizing illegal funds. Why is no one in care about it  while these illicit property is going on and  making dirty money?  Don’t tell me, it’s because no one is aware  of  that. The scale of money laundering is usually hundreds of millions，and there is no one aware of  such a large economic activity, are you kidding me?  But why these people don’t care about it ?   They ignore the illicit activity,  just wait for the last stage when the criminals doing money laundering, and let you find all these criminals and save the world? Why don't you report and complaint the corrupt officials around you? They are more harmful.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think anti-money is mainly a technology problem issue？See this page,  <url>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-04/commonwealth-bank-pay-$700-million-fine-money-laundering-breach/9831064</url>.  Commonwealth Bank got the fine because it  failed to report the 53,506 transactions， 53,506  transactions  you know?  Think about that  there are many countries and regions  which are performs as  the haven for money laundering, tax avoidance, gambling, and asset transfer directly  in the world. Normally, anti-money laundering is rule based, requires little about algorithm, it ask you to learn more about the law, not computer.

&nbsp;&nbsp; money laundering about one of Chinese biggest bank HongKong(Asia) department with its executives involved, if you are interested, search on  yourself.

&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the  information in the  website  above, the fine of anti-money laundering in a whole year for all of banks in China may even not exceed the turnover of Apple, MicroSoft in a single day, do you believe that, all of banks, a whole year.  There are thousands of financial company in china, which means the average fine of anti-money laundering for each financial company  is incrediable low, even not  enough to hire people to do that.   If you are a student in China,  I strongly suggest you stop doing anti-money laundering, you will know how hard it would be  to find a job when you are about graduate from school, but it was too late.  And it will be similar, both the fine of anti-money laundering and the difficulty for you to find a job in many other countries. In Europe and North America, the situation may be better， because  the financial system is quite mature there, and the governments pay more attentions to the anti-money laundering problem.    In China, I have never heard of any listed company  whose primary business is anti-money laundering, and I have never heard bankruptcy beacause of anti-money laundering problem   around the world.   

I hope you can stop doing anti-money laundering and find a good job, especially you or your family are poor. Anti-money laundering can not bring you anything, except for the suffering when you want to find a job. If you have similar experience, please give me a star, let other people know that I am telling the truth.


Quoting a Chinese poem：

                                                  满纸荒唐言，一把辛酸泪。 

                                                  都云作者痴，谁解其中味。 
English version:

                                                Pages full of fantastic talk,

                                                Penned with bitter tears;

                                                All men call the author mad,

                                                None his message hears.

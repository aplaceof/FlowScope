### first: do not send me any email

Maybe, you can connect to shenghua liu, the second author of this paper for help, his email is  liushenghua at ict.ac.cn, just replace at with @.

### second： anti-money laundering is not a good choice 

Anti-money laundering is not fundmental, or prerequisite to any other business. What all company want is money, is porfit, but anti-money laundering does not create any value directly. 

If you can build a car, why choose to repair a car? Your repairment can get paied just because the car is valuable, who want to repair a car valued at 10,000, but spend 11,000? Yes, I am say about doing something that create value directly compared with the other supporting conditions. You might argue there are many job about security(supporting conditions)，and get high pay. But you need to distinguish them carefully, the basic security, such as personal safety, cyber security, is the prerequisites to all  other things, and the people protect such security always get high pay, or have great power. The army and police protect national security and personal safety enjoys great power, and the soft engineers who ensure cyber security protecting  server from attacking, customer information from leakage or financial system from being alerted get their high pay. But abnormal detection or anti-money laundering is not that case,  the purpose for doing these things is limiting them in a reasonable range, not eradicates them completely, which is totally different from security. 

Anti-money laundering is an useless and worthless thing for a person who want to find a good job, and it is also worthless for a company.  If you are doing this now, I suggest you stop, and maybe you could choose software development as your career. 

If you don't trust me, search the annual report of the company of  LexisNexis or RELX, one of the biggest company that have anti-money laundering business, and  their mainly business operators in Europe and North America, where the financial system is quite mature, and the governments pay more attentions to the anti-money laundering problem.  you can know how much you can earn when you doing anti-money laundering. 

In many cases, anti-money laundering is not a technical issue. Suppose I am omniscient and omnipotent, knowing of all people that involved in money laundering,  and I submit the list of these people to  you, do you dare to arrest these people? Many people who are capable of doing laundering money are high-ranking officials, wealthy people, terrorists, underworld, and drug dealers. Who do you think you are, struggle against  these people, confiscate their money, and arrest them? They can kill you even you  touch their finger. Why don’t you just go home and tell your mother, and now I have detected a high-ranking military officer or terrorists while doing do anti-money laundering, I’m going to send him into jail, and let your mother beat you as hard as  she can, at least,  It is possible for her to see you in the future. The police, even militry does not want to care about this and fight aginst them, who do you think you are? Do you have any gun in your hand, does the goverment  promise you extremely strict security?  Even chairman of the bank,  your top leader, will pretend not to see such money laundering behavior, how about you, a poor clerk or software engineer. Who wants to  get into  trouble with money, especially the financial  the financial sector. 

Have you ever thought about it, money laundering is the last step of  illicit property  activity, legalizing illegal funds. Why is no one in care about it  while these illicit property is going on and   making dirty money?  Don’t tell me, it’s because no one is aware  of  that. The scale of money laundering is usually hundreds of millions，and there is no one aware of  such a large economic activity, are you kidding me?  But why these people don’t care about it, answer me?   They ignore the activity  of illicit property,  just wait for the last stage when the criminals doing money laundering, and let you find all these criminals and  save the world? Oh, My dear baby, you'd better go home and drink mother‘s milk, you are too cute. 

See this page, do you think anti-money is mainly a technology problem issue？ https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-04/commonwealth-bank-pay-$700-million-fine-money-laundering-breach/9831064.  Commonwealth Bank got the fine because it  failed to report the 53,506 transactions， 53,506  transactions  you know? 

And there are many countries and regions  in the world   which are performs as  the haven for money laundering, tax avoidance, gambling, and asset transfer directly.  A man, like you have such a sense of justice, why don't you set off a revolution and overthrow the country, and world will be a  Utopia. 

### third:  believe the truth   

Don't trust anyone who says anti-money laundering is a good choice, at least in China. They stressed repeatedly to instill in you that how brighter your feature is if you choose anit-money laundering,  which has never been supported by data and never will, believing the real data you have seen on your own eyes. 

see this introduction  of RELX: at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELX .

see this annual report of RELX at: https://www.relx.com/~/media/Files/R/RELX-Group/documents/reports/annual-reports/2019-annual-report.pdf. 
On page 137,  the section of "ANALYSIS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT", you can see that the revenue of  "Risk & Business Analytics" segment is only 2,316 £m in 2019, and anti-money laundering only a part of it. See the detail at: https://www.relx.com/our-business/market-segments/risk-and-business-analytics.

If you are a Chinese, you could browse the flowing websites, which are more relevant:

anti-money laundering report in 2020, first season :https://www.sohu.com/a/389620462_120052127

See the tiny amount of fine, you can know, what does anti-money laundering  mean to a Chinese bank. The fine of anti-money laundering in a whole year for all of banks in China may even not exceed the turnover of Apple, MicroSoft in a single day, do you believe that, all of banks, a whole year.  There are thousands of financial company in china, which means the average fine of anti-money laundering for each inancial company  is incrediable low, even not  enough to hire people to do that.   If you are a student in China,  I strongly suggest you stop doing anti-money laundering, you will know how hard it would be for you to find a job when you are about graduate from school, but it was too late.  And it will be similar, both the fine of anti-money laundering and the difficulty for you to find a job in many other countries. In Europe and North America, the situation may be better， because  the financial system is quite mature there, and the governments pay more attentions to the anti-money laundering problem.    In China, I have never heard of any listed company  whose primary business is anti-money laundering, and I have never heard bankruptcy beacause of anti-money laundering problem   around the world.   

Surely, you can also search these informations on  your own.  If you are forced to do anti-money laundering, good luck.



Quoting a Chinese poem：

                                                      满纸荒唐言，一把辛酸泪。 

                                                      都云作者痴，谁解其中味。
